# ITERATION 1 REPORT - Hierarchy Dominance Analysis

**Date:** 2026-02-02  
**Schema:** V159 (Hierarchy Dominance Metrics)

---

## 📊 ITERATION 1 RESULTS

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 9.0% (9/100 tasks) |
| **Time** | 886.8s (~15 min) |
| **Concepts Alive** | 0 |
| **Total Reuse** | 0 |
| **Max Depth** | 0 |

### Failure Analysis

| Failure Type | Count | Percentage |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| SEARCH_BUDGET_EXCEEDED | 90 | 90% |
| UNKNOWN | 1 | 1% |
| **Total Failures** | 91 | - |

## 🔍 HIERARCHY DOMINANCE ASSESSMENT

### Verdict: ❌ HIERARCHY NOT YET ACTIVE

**Evidence:**
1. **Concepts Alive = 0**: No concepts were mined
   - The 9 successful programs don't share patterns
   - Or patterns appear in only 1 task each (min_reuse=2 required)

2. **SEARCH_BUDGET_EXCEEDED = 90%**: Search is primitive-dominated
   - System is exploring exhaustively with primitives
   - No concept guidance to reduce search space

3. **Max Depth = 0**: No hierarchical composition observed
   - All solutions are flat (if any have CSV_CALL, it's depth 1)

## 📈 EXPECTATIONS vs REALITY

| Expected (at start) | Observed | Status |
|---------------------|----------|--------|
| Low accuracy (5-15%) | 9.0% | ✅ Expected |
| No concepts initially | 0 concepts | ✅ Expected |
| SEARCH_BUDGET dominant | 90% | ✅ Expected |
| Hierarchy not active | Confirmed | ✅ Expected |

**This is NORMAL for iteration 1.** The system is:
1. Learning what works and what doesn't
2. Collecting traces for mining
3. Building the foundation for concept emergence

## 🎯 WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN ITERATION 2+

1. **Concept Emergence**: Will any concepts be mined?
   - Need 2+ tasks solved with similar pattern
   
2. **SEARCH_BUDGET_EXCEEDED Trend**: Does it decrease?
   - If concepts emerge, should guide search better
   
3. **Accuracy Improvement**: Does it increase?
   - With concepts, some tasks should become "easier"

4. **Reuse Signal**: Do concepts appear in multiple tasks?
   - This is the KEY indicator of hierarchy activation

---

## 🚫 ACTIONS NOT TO TAKE

Per "Phase de Vie du Système" protocol:
- ❌ DO NOT interrupt training
- ❌ DO NOT reduce depth or programs
- ❌ DO NOT change laws/gates/criteria
- ❌ DO NOT optimize yet

**The system is still learning to speak.**

---

## 📋 NEXT CHECKPOINT

After iteration 2 completes:
1. Compare accuracy (did it improve?)
2. Check concepts_alive (did any emerge?)
3. Check SEARCH_BUDGET % (did it decrease?)
4. Look for conceptual solutions (CSV_CALL in program_steps)
