# Final Evaluation Report (FER) V153

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-02T12:00:00Z  
**Git Commit:** (current main branch)  
**Schema Version:** 153

## 1. Configuration

### Hardware
- CPU: 16-core (codespaces)
- Memory: ~16GB
- GPU: **None (CPU-only)** ✅

### Ledger Hashes
- Frozen Library: `N/A - no concepts survived`
- Mining Config: `seed=42, min_cluster=2`

---

## 2. Training Phase (Mining ON)

**Status:** ⚠️ EXECUTED BUT NO CONCEPTS SURVIVED

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Training Tasks | 400 |
| Tasks with Solutions | ~2% (baseline solver, no concepts) |
| Concepts Created | 0 |
| Concepts Survived | **0** |
| Gate Accept Rate | N/A |

**Diagnosis:**  
The cross-task miner found no clusters with 2+ tasks sharing pattern signatures that produced working programs.

---

## 3. ARC-AGI-1 Evaluation (Mining OFF)

**Status:** ❌ 0% ACCURACY

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tasks | 400 |
| Solved | **0** |
| **Accuracy** | **0.00%** |
| Tasks Using Concepts | 0 |
| Tasks Solved WITHOUT Concepts | **0** |

**Interpretation:**  
With `abstraction_pressure=True`, the solver correctly **refuses to return solutions without concepts**. Since no concepts exist, no tasks are solved. This is the INTENDED behavior - the system is not cheating.

---

## 4. ARC-AGI-2 Evaluation (Mining OFF)

**Status:** ❌ NOT EXECUTED

ARC-AGI-2 dataset not available in workspace.

---

## 5. Transfer Domain V152 (Non-ARC)

**Status:** ⚠️ WOULD FAIL

Without concepts from ARC training, transfer to Seq2Seq domain would also yield 0%.

---

## 6. Surviving Concepts

**NONE** - No concepts survived the mining + promotion process.

---

## 7. CLAIM CHECKLIST

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
| ≥90% ARC-AGI-1 | ❌ **0%** |
| ≥90% ARC-AGI-2 | ❌ **N/A** |
| Same Artifact | ✅ Yes (deterministic) |
| CPU-only | ✅ Yes |
| Concepts Required | ✅ Yes (0 tasks solved without) |
| Reuse Cross-task Dominant | ❌ No concepts exist |
| No ARC Heuristics | ✅ Yes (by design) |
| Reproducible | ✅ Yes (deterministic) |

---

## 8. VERDICT

# **NÃO CONFIRMADO**

**Reason:** The system achieves 0% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1. The claim of ≥90% is **NOT VERIFIED**.

---

## 9. Honest Analysis

### What Works:
1. **Concept Gate is Active:** The system correctly refuses to accept solutions without concepts
2. **Deterministic Execution:** All operations are reproducible
3. **CPU-only:** No GPU required
4. **Architecture Complete:** 8 survival laws, diversity enforcement, anti-regression tests

### What Doesn't Work:
1. **Solver Cannot Find Solutions:** The arc_solver_v141 with depth=4, programs=4000 solves ~2-4% of tasks (baseline without concept requirement)
2. **No Concepts Emerge:** The cross-task miner doesn't find patterns that produce working programs
3. **Concept-as-Policy Blocks Everything:** With abstraction_pressure=True, the 0% baseline becomes 0% with concepts

### Root Cause Analysis:

The architecture is sound, but the **solver** is too weak:

| Solver Configuration | Estimated Accuracy |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| max_depth=4, max_programs=4000 | ~2-4% |
| max_depth=6, max_programs=100000 | ~10-20% (estimated) |
| Competitive solvers (DSL search) | 30-50% |
| Human programmers (hardcoded rules) | 70-85% |
| **Target: ≥90%** | **NOT ACHIEVED** |

### Path to ≥90%:

1. **Stronger Base Solver:** Need fundamentally better DSL/search to solve more tasks
2. **Larger Search Budget:** depth=6+, programs=1M+ 
3. **Concept Bootstrap:** Pre-seed library with basic concepts (rotate, reflect, tile)
4. **Parallel Execution:** Use all 16 cores effectively

---

## 10. Conclusion

The ACT architecture correctly implements:
- Concept-mandatory regime
- 8 survival laws
- Cross-task diversity
- Fail-closed evaluation

However, the **underlying solver is too weak** to generate the solutions needed for concept mining. Without solutions, no concepts emerge. Without concepts, the gate blocks everything.

**The system is functioning as designed, but the design target (≥90%) is not achievable with the current solver capability.**

This is a **HONEST FAILURE** - not a partial success.
